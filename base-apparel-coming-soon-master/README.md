## Overview

### The challenge

![](design/desktop-design.jpg)

The challenge is to build out this feature section and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size.
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty;
  - The email address is not formatted correctly.
